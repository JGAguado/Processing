* **/Robotic Arm** - This software project allows the visualization of a Robotic Arm 3D model syncronized with a real scale model. Kinematics are supposed to be identical as both parts (virtual and phisical model) are communicated via Serial port.
Based on the project [CREATE A ROBOTICS SIMULATOR USING PROCESSING] (http://www.instructables.com/id/Create-a-Robotics-simulator-using-Processing/) developped by [CoreTechRobotics](http://www.instructables.com/member/CoreTechRobotics/)
